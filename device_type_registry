# Device Type IDs are allocated on an as-needed basis; the canonical location
# of this document is the authoritative list of Device Type IDs.
# Device IDs are allocated in units of 4096 (bottom 12 bits free) to various
# manufacturers; it is the responsibility of that manufacturer to ensure that
# Device IDs are never reused.
