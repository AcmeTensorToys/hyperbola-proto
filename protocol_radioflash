This document defines the Hyperbola commands specific to Radioflash
controllers.

Radioflash controllers have up to 16 groups of 8 outputs.  The low nibble of
each command in the table below specifies to which group the command
applies.  Radioflash devices, in IDENTIFY THYSELF Hyperbola commands, may
(optionally) return an additional single byte indicating how many channel
groups are in use.  Channel groups not in use must DESCRIBE themselves as
empty.

0x1_	DESCRIBE INPUTS
0x2_	DESCRIBE OUTPUTS
0x3_	REPORT INPUTS
0x4_	REPORT OUTPUTS

	Command forms when with zero more bytes, response payloads with 8 bytes
	of data attached.  REPORT commands return the levels of I/O.  DESCRIBE
	return from the following two type tables:

	Input types:
		0x00	None (no input at this offset in this group)
		0x01	High Voltage Control Feedback (V)
		0x02	Constant Current Control Feedback (.1 mA)

	Output types:
		0x00	None (no output at this offset in this group)
		0x01	High Voltage Control Target (V)
		0x02	Constant Current Control Target (.1 mA)

	It is RECOMMENDED, for simplicity, that Feedback input types occupy the
	same address (group and offset) as the devices they control.  Related
	I/O should be kept in the same channel group.

0x5_	REPORT OUTPUT GATES

	Returns a one-byte payload with the output gate for this group.

0x6_	SET OUTPUT GATES

	Takes a one-byte payload enabling(1) or disabling (0) each output.
	Replies with a REPORT OUTPUT GATE payload.

0x7_	SET OUTPUTS
	Takes a 9-byte payload.  The first byte is a bitmask specifying which
	of the 8 subsequent bytes are used to set outputs.

	Responds with a REPORT OUTPUTS payload.  Note the reported values
	will be subject to any clamping done by the controller.

0xA_	TIMED SET OUTPUT GATES

	A three byte payload specifies the wait time, the hold time, and the
	output gate to have during that hold time.  The output gate is restored
	to its current value after the hold time has elapsed.

	Time scales are in hundredths of a second.

	Only one TIMED SET OUTPUT GATE is allowed in each group.

	A SET OUTPUT GATES command during either the hold or wait time will
	immediately set the output gates and clear the TIMED SET comand

	Replies with a 1-byte payload:
		0x00	success, waiting
		0x01	TIMED SET already in progress, not enqueued
