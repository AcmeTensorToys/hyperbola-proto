This defines the Nordic RF chipset (nRF24*) payload for Hyperbola packets.
As might be expected, this system takes advantage of the underlying packeted
nature of the transport, does not permit straddling, etc.  Moreover, to
avoid the oddities of nRF's MAC scheme, we use the medium as a broadcast
channel and use Hyperbola addresses and device IDs to sort it all out.

Hyperbola devices speaking nRF SHALL come pre-configured with no
Hyperbola-layer device ID and using a nRF parameters as follows:
	Mode:		Enhanced Shock-Burst, Auto-Acknowledge
	Data rate:	2 Mbps
	MAC size:	5 bytes
	MAC:		D8:CB:45:B8:D6 (truncated MD5 of "hyperbola")
	channel:	0xC6 (first byte of same)
	checksums:	2 bytes

nRF imposes a 32 byte limit on all packets, which in turn means that all
Hyberbola payloads are at most 28 bytes long.

The SET UNDERLYING COMMUNICATIONS PARAMETERS command payload contains a
subcommand vocabulary, allowing various parameters to be tuned.
	0x00	CHANNEL (one byte follows)
	0x01	MAC ADDRESS (bytes follow; must be 3, 4, or 5)
Only a single subcommand may be sent per payload.
